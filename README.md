##About
I create a Yelp clone called food-critic using only front-end javascript. I implemented some of Yelp's main features such as the ability to search for restuarants, view a list of reviews for a restuarant, add a new restuarant that isn't on the list. The user can also sort through the results and tag reviews that he or she found useful, funny, or cool.

You can view a live version at http://food-critic.herokuapp.com/
